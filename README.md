# zed-supabase

Git-backed Supabase provider overlays for [`zed-pkg`](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/kjokwhqlbfoxbdvnekon), mapped to [`zed-pkg`](https://github.com/zed-pkg).

The Zed persistence contract is catalogued from `zed-lib-core`; the Supabase baseline and deployable migration history are still pending.

## Project inventory

| Project ref | Local slug | Canonical | Provider status | Git working directory | Integration |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `zxjvldcyqobiupeiwjhx` | `zed-pkg-main` | yes | active | `projects/zxjvldcyqobiupeiwjhx` | planned |

The catalog is `catalog.json`; each hosted project has a machine-readable `target.json`. Project refs and organization refs are public routing identifiers, not credentials. Database passwords, connection URLs, tokens, keys, data, and dumps never belong in this repository.

## Authority

- Cross-database persistence contracts: the target's `contractSource`, preferring `*-lib-core`.
- Supabase-only provider overlays: this repository.
- Explicit convergence and drift analysis: [`declarative-migrations/declarative-postgres-migrate.rs`](https://github.com/declarative-migrations/declarative-postgres-migrate.rs).
- Fleet target registry and verification: [`ORESoftware/k8s-libs-and-shared-defs`](https://github.com/ORESoftware/k8s-libs-and-shared-defs).
- API, authentication, and synchronization dependencies remain owned by [`ORESoftware/api-docs`](https://github.com/ORESoftware/api-docs), [`shared-auth`](https://github.com/shared-auth), and [`opto-sync`](https://github.com/opto-sync).

Supabase and AWS RDS Postgres may be intentionally out of step. No automated job treats catalog equality as an invariant.

## Current gate

All discovered targets begin in `planned`. Production deployment is disabled until a reviewed `supabase db pull` baseline, contract-source readiness, migration/RLS tests, branch protection, exact repository/working-directory verification, provider preview, and production read-back are recorded.

## Shared fleet contract

`shared-defs.lock.json` pins contract version `1.0.0` and immutable commit
`577fb7fb67444266e2f13b0945811c320c82f26c` from
`ORESoftware/k8s-libs-and-shared-defs`. Validation compares normalized schema
digests, so local schema identifiers may remain relative while their behavior
cannot drift from the reviewed fleet contract. The Zed coordinate is
`oresoftware/supabase-gitops-contract`.

Run:

```sh
just validate
```
